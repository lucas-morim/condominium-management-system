# 🏢 Condominium Management System

A desktop application developed in **Visual Basic**, following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project was designed to **automate and simplify condominium data management**, including **resident registration, data queries, and report generation** — helping property management teams work more efficiently.

---

## 📋 Overview

The **Condominium Management System** provides an organized and user-friendly interface to handle essential administrative operations.  
It was developed to reduce manual effort, minimize data errors, and improve the overall efficiency of condominium management.

---

## 🤝 Real-World Application

This system was developed for a **real client**, who actively participated throughout the entire development process.  
Their feedback helped identify actual pain points in daily operations, allowing the software to directly **solve real management challenges**, such as:

- Manual resident data tracking  
- Inefficient report generation  
- Lack of centralized information management  

Through iterative collaboration and testing, the final solution met all functional requirements and improved workflow efficiency in a real condominium administration environment.
